silverstripe-wysihtml5
======================

Implementation of xing/wysihtml5 as a SilverStripe form type

Compatibility
-------------

2.4 only so far, but if someone wants to do the required work, I'm happy to make a new branch for it.

Badness
=======

Oh, it's very bad. You probably shouldn't use this, unless you're in a rush (and if you're using a 2.4 site, you probably are).
